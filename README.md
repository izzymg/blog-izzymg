##### Next.JS project for the front-end of my blog.

I wanted to learn Next.JS, so before I set my eyes on a more complex application, I decided to knock out a dead simple SSG form using a Headless CMS hosted on my home server.

As you"ve for sure heard before, new posts on the CMS trigger a webhook and regenerate the prod site. The prod site is hosted on the cloud so it"s nice and fast, while my old dinosaur of a plex machine/home server hosts the CMS.
